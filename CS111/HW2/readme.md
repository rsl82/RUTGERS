#PARTY

Write your code in the file Party.java. Use the IO module to read inputs and output answers.Suppose that you are responsible for buying pizza and soda for your employer's annual company party. You must buy entire pizza pies and cases of soda (boxes of soda cans). You cannot buy individual slices of pizza or cans of soda, nor can you buy fractional numbers of pizza pies or soda cases.

Ask the user for the following information, in this order:

the number of people attending the party
the number of slices of pizza each person should be able to eat
the number of cans of soda each person should be able to drink
the cost of a pizza pie
the number of slices in a pizza pie
the cost of a case of soda
the number of cans in a case of soda
Compute the total cost of the pizza and soda you will need to buy. Do not buy more than you need to in order to supply each partygoer with the desired number of pizza slices and soda cans.

For this problem only, you may assume that the user will only enter positive numbers (you do not need to check for this).

#PAYFEE

Write your code in the file PayFee.java. Use the IO module to read inputs and output answers.

You work for the a payment processing service called PayFee. PayFee charges money receivers the following fees


The first $500 has a flat fee of $10.
Payments over $500 (but under $5000) have a fee of 1% or $20, whichever is higher.
Payments $5,000 (but under $10,000)  and over have a fee of 2% or $120, whichever is higher.
Payments $10,000 and over are subject to fees as follows:

The first $10,000 have a fee of 2%
The next $5,000 have an additional fee of 3%
Anything more will demand an additional fee of 4%

For example, an payment of $40,000 would be subject to $1350 fee: 2% on the first $10,000 ($200 fee), 3% on the next $5,000 ($150 fee), and 4% on the last $25,000 ($1000 tax).

Ask the user for their payment amount (real number) and compute the amount of the fee that they owe (real number).
